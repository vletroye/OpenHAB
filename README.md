# About this repository
This repository contain developments done around the [OpenHab](https://www.openhab.org) installed on my Synology as explained [here](https://www.beatificabytes.be/install-openhab-2-on-synology).

## "Widgets"
It contains json files exported from HABPanel's Custom Widgets I have created for my own purpose.
Documentation about those Custom Widgets will be made available in the Wiki.

Those json files can be imported in your own openHAB's HABPanel.

## "Html"
It contains a folder "vletroye" with all the custom artefacts I need to customize my openHab, such as images and controllers.

The folder "vletroye" is intended to be copied in openHab's folder /conf/html (Ex.: if openHab was installed as mine on a Synolog: under \\<YourNas>\\SmartHome\openHAB\conf\html\vletroye\...)
