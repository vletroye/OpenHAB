# Widget Display All Switches

**_THIS WIDGET IS STILL AN ALPHA VERSION_**

This Widget can be used in the [HABPanel](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/habpanel.html#designing-dashboard-interfaces-with-habpanel) of [OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org) to display a widget-switch for each item of type ["switch"](https://www.openhab.org/docs/concepts/items.html#items) in a given group (I.e.: items which can be turned on/off).

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/vletroye/OpenHAB/wiki/Widget-Confirm-Switch) for a more detailed description.
