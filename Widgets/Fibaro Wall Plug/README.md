# Widget Fibaro Wall Plug

**_THIS WIDGET IS A PRE-RELEASE VERSION_**

This Widget can be used in the [HABPanel](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/habpanel.html#designing-dashboard-interfaces-with-habpanel) of [OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org) to control a Fibaro Wall Plug accessible via a Z-Wave Bridge (https://www.openhab.org/addons/bindings/zwave/). Ex.: a FGWP102 Metered Wall Plug Switch.

The widget can be configured to 
* request a confirmation before turning on/off the plug, 
* display the current power consumption and the total power consumption,
* reset the total power consumption, to change the color of the LED ring when th eplug is on or off

It can also trigger a color loop on the plug, which is useful to visually identify the plug.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/vletroye/OpenHAB/wiki/Widget-Fibaro-Wall-Plug) for a more detailed description.
