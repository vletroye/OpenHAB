# Widget Confirm Rollershutter

**_THIS WIDGET IS STILL AN ALPHA VERSION_**

This Widget can be used in the [HABPanel](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/habpanel.html#designing-dashboard-interfaces-with-habpanel) of [OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org) to control any item of type ["rollershutter"](https://www.openhab.org/docs/concepts/items.html#items) (typically used for blinds, garage doors, ...).

The widget can be configured to request a confirmation before moving the item up or down. Ex.: to prevent you to open the garage door by accident.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/vletroye/OpenHAB/wiki/Widget-Confirm-Rollershutter) for a more detailed description.
